## Node Log ##

This is a modification of [ry/node_chat](http://github.com/ry/node_chat) with the purpose of making a dead-simple tool for entering "log" messages. For instance, I use this to keep track of the particulars of my deploys.

**To run:**

	$ node server.js
	
**Requires (NPM):**

* querystring
* underscore
* persistencejs

That's all taken care of in `package.json`. To install those dependencies, just run:

	$ npm install
